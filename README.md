## State Management
Global variables + observer pattern + React custom hooks compose a lightweight yet powerful mechanism to manage states across application.
This mechanism plays a main core in [State Pool](https://www.npmjs.com/package/state-pool) - a React state management lib

- A centralized repository (or folder) where all application states live within is preferred. Having an overview of all application states and how they are dependent on each other is super helpful
